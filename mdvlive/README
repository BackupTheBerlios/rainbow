# This is still the old README for the mklivecd version

The latest stable version of the package can alway be found at
the following URL:

    http://livecd.berlios.de

The package naming tries to follow the Linux kernel approach to
versioning, i.e. versions are in the format "major.minor.patch"
where an uneven minor version number indicates an unstable and/or
testing release.

If you want to contibute, or just fancy running the latest-
greatest version, you can also get the latest development version
from CVS:

    export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.livecd.berlios.de:/cvsroot/livecd
    cvs login (There is no anonymous password, a simple Enter will do)
    cvs -z3 co mklivecd

If you have been granted developer access to the project, you can
access CVS with the following commands:

    export CVS_RSH=ssh
    export CVSROOT=:ext:USERNAME@cvs.livecd.berlios.de:/cvsroot/livecd
    cvs -z3 co mklivecd

There is a mailing list available for discussion of the mklivecd
scripts and associated programs. More information on this list,
including subscription details can be found at:

    http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/livecd-users
    http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/livecd-devel

Patches, suggestions, flames and general comments are always
welcome at the above adress. Good luck!
